James Lingford read <em>The Selfish Gene</em> when he was a teenager and thought it was so mind-blowing he decided to study genetics at university. He learned much about genetics, but by the end of his degree he came to the sinking realisation that the only reason genes are able to do stuff is because they make proteins. So James decided to he better learn _something_ about proteins, otherwise this whole genetics thing was a bit mystifying. Since then he has been spiralling down a never ending rabbit hole of reading about proteins. It turns out there's a _lot_ of them, and they all do different things, and all have different structures, and no one can really predict how they fold, and that a lot of enyzmatic catalysis is still a bit of a mystery, and their evolution is really interesting, and that they can be really dynamic and floppy, oh and they can also be modified post-translationally by other proteins and oh boy it gets very complicated.
